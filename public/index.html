                                This is a web application for marketing managers to manage ad campaigns and assign
                                users to specific ad campaigns. Their are two classes of users: managers and general users.
                                Managers can create and manage campaigns, ads and users. They can assign users to specific campaigns
                                and correspond with their users through a messaging system. Users have their accounts created by managers
                                and are granted access to campaigns by their managers. Once they have access to a campaign, they can create
                                and manage ads for that campaign. They also have the ability to message their manager if need be.

                                To briefly describe the data model of this application, there are 5 objects: managers, users, campaigns, ads and messages.
                                Managers have a one-to-many relationship with users, campaigns and messages. Users have a one-to-many relationship with messages
                                and a many-to-many relationship with campaigns. Campaigns have a one-to-many relationship with ads. This is represented in this diagram (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/QTgwz1p.png">link</a>).
